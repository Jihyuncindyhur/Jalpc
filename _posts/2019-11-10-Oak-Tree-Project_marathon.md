I ran 10K marathon for the first time in my life!
My record was 1 hour and 8 mins, and I could've never done this without my dear friend from WashU and running mate, Emily :)

Oak Tree Run is a fundrasining marathon with a theme of 'Run for the Orphans.' Most of our registration fees are donated to support scholarships for children who are ready to enter colleges. I was truly glad to participate in this meaningful marathon especially because I was running not just for myself but for the children who have so much potential to brighten this world. 

About my running, 10K was definitely doable. But, I had had plantar fasciitis for two weeks after the marathon, and my knees are still aching when I go downstairs or run. I never trained myself before the marathon, and with no doubt, I overpaced it.

So, new lessons learned! Always try to be trained, prepared, and never overpace. 1 hour of overpacing could require 1 month (or more) of recovery.
