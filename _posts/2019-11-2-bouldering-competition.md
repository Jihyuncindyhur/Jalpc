I won first place at 2019 Bouldering Competition held by Seoul National University.
Competed with only four other participants, but truly exciting experience!
Bouldering taught me how to climb, overcome, sometimes even conquer an immediate obstacle on my way. But I also learned how to rest, appreciate others' amazing bouldering abilities, and enjoy little chatting with other boulders. 

Life could be like bouldering-you must believe you are brave enough to move on at the moment when you doubt.
